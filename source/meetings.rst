Project Meetings 
##################

All meetings associated with the yt project (with the exception of the steering
committee) will be announced publicly to the
community through communication channels, including slack, the yt-dev and yt-users 
mailing lists. Meeting notes will be subsequently posted and announced in the
aforementioned channels and in the `project records 
<https://github.com/yt-project/project-records>`_ repository. 
All are welcome to attend, no matter their
level of participation within the project. If part of the meeting requires a
closed session, the meeting will adjourn to a closed meeting and notes will be
made available at a later time. In all cases, meetings will be open for as long
as possible.

Steering Committee Meetings
---------------------------

Public meetings, optimally including all members of the steering committee,
should happen at least once a quarter. These meetings are to encourage frank
and open discussion about the future of the project. Meetings will happen over
video chat to encourage remote participation, and times should be chosen to
accomodate international attendees. The meetings invite will be public, and any
interested developer or user is welcome to attend. When necessary, steering
committee meetings may need to adjourn to a closed session for sensitive
discussions. 

Maintainer Coworking Meetings
-----------------------------

Twice monthly, or as required, video chats should be held to ensure timely review
of pending maintainence of the project. This may include triaging new issues,
reviewing new PRs, or submitting bugfixes together. These meetings will attempt
to address all unaddressed maintenance issues, and any outstanding tasks will
be discussed and mentioned publicly as a comment on the pull request. Any
developer, reviewer, maintainer, or user is welcome to attend this meeting.
Developers who have open pull requests they would like to see reviewed are
particularly encouraged to attend to aid and facilitate 
discussion about the pull request.
Finally, new contributors to the project are especially encouraged to attend. 

Team Meetings
-------------

As needed, the teams outlined in the above team structure can meet to discuss
maintenance and feature development for areas within the yt project. These
teams will announce their meetings publicly and make them accessible to members
of the community.
