.. _voting:

Voting Items
############

Decisions about the future of the project are made through discussion with all
members of the community. All non-sensitive project management discussion takes
place on the project developers’ mailing list, the issue tracker, and in the
project meetings mentioned above. Occasionally, sensitive discussion occurs on
a private list, but the project defaults to open meetings.

The yt-project uses a “consensus seeking” process for making large,
project-changing decisions. The
group tries to find a resolution that has no open objections among project
members. At any point during the discussion, any project member can call for
a vote, which will conclude two weeks from the call for the vote. Any vote must
be backed by a YTEP. If no option can gather two thirds of the votes cast, the
decision is escalated to the Steering Committee, which in turn will use
consensus seeking with the fallback option of a simple majority vote if no
consensus can be found within a month. 
This is what we hereafter may refer to as “the decision making process”.

Decisions (in addition to adding project members and Steering Committee
membership as above) are made according to the following rules (+1 is
equivalently an approval vote on a pull request):

Minor Documentation Changes
---------------------------

Minor Documentation changes, such as typo fixes, or addition / correction of a
sentence: Requires +1 by a project member, no -1 by a project member (lazy
consensus), happens on the issue or pull request page. Project members are
expected to give “reasonable time” to others to give their opinion on the pull
request if they’re not confident others would agree.

Code Changes and Major Documentation Changes
--------------------------------------------

Code changes and major documentation changes require +1 by two project members,
no -1 by a project member (lazy consensus), happens on the issue of
pull-request page.

Changes to the API Principles and Changes to Dependencies or Supported Versions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes to the API principles and changes to dependencies or supported versions
happen via a Enhancement proposals (YTEPs) and follows the decision-making
process outlined above.

Changes to the Project Governance 
---------------------------------------

Changes to the project governance model use the same decision process outlined
above. 

Changes to the governance documents which do not impact the high-level model
follow the same process as *code changes and major documentation changes*.

.. note:: 
   If a veto -1 vote is cast on a lazy consensus, the proposer can appeal to the
   community and project members and the change can be approved or rejected using
   the decision making procedure outlined above.

.. important:: 
   Project members are expected to attempt to resolve issues with
   the contributor before casting a veto vote. Resolving issues here may be
   proposing alternative implementations, alternative language, or a variant of
   the solution that the project member feels is more workable. Project members
   are expected to use veto votes sparingly. 

Project Membership
------------------

**Entry** 

A member is someone who has made continued and significant contribution to the
project (changes to the codebase, discussion on mailing lists, feedback on pull
requests, documentation, teaching, etc.) for some period of time. 
After such a period, potential new members are nominated for membership by an
existing member and confirmed by positive votes from three additional members.
Once a developer becomes a member, they remain a member for life. A member
maintains the option to give up their membership and have their name removed
from the list. 

**Removal** 

Finally, project membership may be revoked for anyone who is deemed to be
directly harmful to the project or the community upon a nomination by another
member and five supporting member votes. Once five supporting member votes are
reached, the member is nominated for revoked membership and the decision is
sent to the steering committee for a final vote. The vote made by the steering
committee must be equal or greater than 3/5. Revoking membership will result in a
loss of commit rights to yt project repositories and removal of membership from
project pages.
