yt project governance 
=====================

The mission of the yt project is to create tools to visualize, analyze, and
explore scientific data for the natural sciences. The core package of the yt
project is `yt <https://github.com/yt-project/yt>`_, but our `organization
<https://github.com/yt-project>`_ includes a number of packages that lie within
this theme. 

The purpose of these pages are to formalize the governance structure of the
core yt package and packages hosted within the yt project github organization.
Broadly, these pages provide an overview of our values, decision-making
processes, and how the project is organized. Our governance aims to embue the
following principles:

* Project openness & transparency
* An active, welcoming environment for contribution
* An inclusive, welcoming environment for users of all skill levels
* Institutional neutrality
